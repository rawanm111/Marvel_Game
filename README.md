# marvel-game
Designed and constructed "Marvel," a computer game with three milestones, utilising Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. Milestone 1 involved establishing a packaging hierarchy, implementing necessary data structures, and enabling basic data loading from a CSV file. Milestone 2 focused on developing a functional game engine with all required logic, playable through the console. Milestone 3 entailed integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance the gaming experience. The implementation demonstrated proficiency in OOP concepts, game development, and GUI programming using Java.
